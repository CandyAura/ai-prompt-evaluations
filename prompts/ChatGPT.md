Setting healthy boundaries **without damaging relationships** is about communication, consistency, and respect—for both yourself and the other person. Here’s a simple guide to help navigate this:

⸻

✅ **1. Get Clear on Your Needs**

Before you talk to anyone, ask yourself:

•	What’s making me uncomfortable or overwhelmed?

•	What do I need to feel safe, respected, and balanced?

Example: “I need alone time after work to recharge.”

⸻

✅ **2. Communicate Early and Calmly**

Timing and tone matter. Don’t wait until you’re frustrated. Bring it up when things are calm and say it with kindness.

Say:

“Hey, I’ve realized I feel better when I get some quiet time after work. Can we catch up a little later in the evening instead?”

⸻

✅ **3. Use “I” Statements, Not Accusations**

This keeps the other person from feeling blamed or attacked.

Instead of: “You never respect my time!”

Try: “I feel overwhelmed when plans change last minute. I’d appreciate a heads-up.”

⸻

✅ **4. Be Consistent but Flexible**

Enforce your boundary calmly, even if others push back. But stay open to compromise when it makes sense.

“I can’t lend money right now. I care about you, but I need to stick to my budget.”

⸻

✅ **5. Accept That Some Discomfort Is Normal**

Not everyone will like your boundaries at first. That doesn’t mean the relationship is doomed—people often need time to adjust.

⸻

✅ **6. Notice Who Respects Your Boundaries**

Healthy relationships survive boundaries—often they get stronger. If someone continually disrespects yours, that’s a red flag, not a failure on your part.

⸻

**Examples of Healthy Boundaries:**

•	Saying no to plans when you need rest

•	Asking for emotional space during conflict

•	Not responding to messages after a certain time

•	Declining to talk about certain topics
