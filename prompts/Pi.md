Setting healthy boundaries is an important part of maintaining healthy relationships. 

ðŸ’› Here are some tips:

1. Communicate clearly: Explain your boundaries and needs calmly and respectfully. Use "I" statements to express how you feel without blaming others.
2. Be consistent: Apply your boundaries consistently and follow through with consequences if they're not respected.
3. Practice empathy: Understand that others may have different needs and boundaries, and try to see things from their perspective.
4. Offer alternatives: If you need to say no to something, suggest an alternative that works for you and still respects the other person's needs.
5. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist for guidance and encouragement.

Remember, setting boundaries is about taking care of yourself while also respecting others' needs. It can be challenging, but it's worth it to build strong, healthy relationships.
