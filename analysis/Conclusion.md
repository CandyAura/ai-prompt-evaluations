Among the three LLMs evaluated, ChatGPT, Pi, and Gemini each offered distinct strengths.
Pi stood out as the most empathetic and conversational, with a human like tone that made interactions feel emotionally supportive despite its brevity. 
It would be ideal for users seeking a more casual, emotionally attuned experience.
Gemini delivered the most actionable and research backed advice, offering detailed steps, clear behavioral strategies, and links to psychological and medical sources.  
However, its tone was more clinical and detached. ChatGPT struck the best balance for UX communication providing concise, relevant advice with helpful examples, and even prompting the user for further specificity (e.g., tailoring to romantic, family, or work contexts). 
It offered a clear, responsive experience aligned with good UX principles.
Overall, Pi excelled in empathy and natural tone, ChatGPT in clarity and interactivity, and Gemini in depth and citation based authority.
The best choice depends on whether the user values emotional resonance, direct application, or scientific credibility.
